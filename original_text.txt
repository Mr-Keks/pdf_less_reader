We present a simple method of fabricating a hierarchically nanostructured CuO–Cu current
collector by using laser ablation and metal mold imprinting to maximize the surface area. The laser
ablation of the Cu current collector created the CuO nanostructure on the Cu-collector surface.
The microstructure was transferred by subsequent imprinting of the microstructure metal mold on
the Cu collector. Then, the laser-ablation nanostructure was formed. Consequently, a hierarchical
structure is generated. The laser-ablated hierarchical CuO–Cu current collector exhibited an improved
capacity while maintaining a cyclability that is similar to those of conventional graphite batteries.
